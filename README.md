## Prerequisites
Please make sure you have a good understanding of TypeScript before reading this book. If you are new to TypeScript, I recommend reading the [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) first.

Generics are a fundamental concept in TypeScript, so make sure you understand them. You can read the [Generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) section of the TypeScript Handbook. 

After that, make sure you have understand type-level programming. You can read the [Type-Level Programming](https://type-level-typescript.com/) book. 
There are many free chapters available. However, I recommend buying the book to support the author.

## Disclaimer

I did not create these design patterns. I learned from various modern TypeScript open-source projects, including famous ones like Zod, tRPC, Hono, Elysia, and many others, as well as writing the [Nammtham](https://nammatham.thaitype.dev/) (Azure Functions Framework). This process has helped me distill commonly used patterns. 

The type-safe design patterns is not suitable for every project. It is intended for projects that require high code quality and design. Make sure to evaluate whether these patterns are suitable for your project before using them.
