# Examples

Reading open source projects is a great way to learn how to write better code. However, it can be difficult to understand the codebase of a large project. In this book, I will provide examples of code snippets from well-known open-source projects such as Zod, tRPC, Hono, Elysia, and ts-odata-client. I will explain the code and show you how to apply the same patterns to your own projects.
