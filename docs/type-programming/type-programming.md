# Type Programming

Type programming or type-level programmming, definition from [Type-Level Programming](https://type-level-typescript.com/), some developer say about [the Turing Complete type system](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14833) in Typescript. Whatever it is, in my book, I will describe as **Type Programming**.

Type programming is the practice of writing programs that operate on types. In TypeScript, this is done using the type system. Type-level programming is a powerful technique that can be used to create complex type-level computations and to enforce constraints on types.
